# LSTM-Automated-Trading-Bot
The bot uses a Long-Short Term Memory model to predict daily price fluctuations. Predictions are used to automatically manage long/short operations on futures markets through Derivatives Exchange APIs. 

The bot is set to operate on Bitcoin/Usd futures through the FTX Exchange. This small project is a demonstration of how a simple implementation of a ML model provides interesting automated trading solutions. Unfortunately, FTX officially declared bankruptcy, so the API interface has to be re-programmed from scratch.
